# TradingBot
This is a work in progress project. The time-tested strategies that will be used to design the algorithms behind the trading bot are those that are focused on long-term gains. Using technical analysis and statistics, the bot is intended to generate profits through automation rather than manual orders through a brokerage. This would be particularly helpful for those are who can't constantly keep up with market trends and would benefit from investment automation with some customization.
